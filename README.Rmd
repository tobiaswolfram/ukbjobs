# ukbjobs - Information on Occupation in UKB <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="114" />

Occupation plays a pivotal role in an individual's social and economic life, and is often one of the first topics of conversation when meeting someone new. Knowing a person's job can provide valuable insights into their technical skills, economic prospects, general social standing, and how they spend much of their time [@hauser1997socioeconomic]. Occupation is a long-term, stable indicator of an individual's circumstances, including income, wealth, and consumption [p. 60ff, @lambert2018social]. 

Occupation is strongly linked to wellbeing: Workers who occupy lower positions on the occupational ladder tend to report worse health, have a higher probability of disability, and die at an earlier age than workers who occupy higher positions on the occupational ladder [@ravesteijn2013contribution]. Furthermore, late-career exposure to high physical strain and low job control has been found to be comparable to the average health decline that occurs as a result of ageing [@ravesteijn2018wear]. Job satisfaction is also an important factor that plays a role in influencing the health of workers [@faragher2013relationship].

The UK Biobank [UKB, @sudlow2015uk] is a large-scale biomedical research project consisting of a national database containing health information on over 500,000 UK inhabitants. The aim of the project is to improve the health of future generations by providing researchers with a valuable resource for studying the causes of disease. 

Information on UKB respondents' was measured using the SOC2000 structure [@elias2000revision] and occupation is available for the majority of cases. 

In this package, we provide a collection of helpful external information on occupations that can be merged to UKB via SOC2000. This includes the three occupational status metrics CAMSIS, SIOPS and ISEI, as well as a mapping of SOC2000 to the international ISCO-88 occupational classification. Furthermore we make information on occupational means the big 5 personality dimensions, risk taking, mental health, gratification delay and self efficacy based on estimates by @wolfram2023not available.
